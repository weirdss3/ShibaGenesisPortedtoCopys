Ported By **Lunar**  
Notifilib by **dom.csgo** → [xfi0/Aether-Scintilla-Ported](https://github.com/xfi0/Aether-Scintilla-Ported)  

Original GTAG Menu → [zyroyz/AetherTemp-Genesis-](https://github.com/zyroyz/AetherTemp-Genesis-)

##  About
This is a **ported version** of the well-known Gorilla Tag menu **Genesis**, rebranded here as **Shiba Genesis**.  
The goal of this port was to keep the original style, functionality, and layout intact while making it easier to build on for future mods.  

I did **not** make the original project – all credit goes to the developers who created and maintained the Genesis menu.

##  Features
- Based on the **Genesis** menu framework  
- Uses **Notifilib** by dom.csgo for notifications  
- Clean UI, customizable, and extendable  
- Ported with compatibility in mind
